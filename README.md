Hi, I am Dani, currently working as Relay Protection Engeineer responsible for testing, commissioning, calculation, parametrization 
of protection relays for Electrical Power Systems.

I am fan of C++ programming language currenty in the processs of learning. 
I would declare myself as a junior trying to earn as much experience as I can doing C++ coding in my spare time. 

Maybe one day I'm gonna change career, who knows... :)
